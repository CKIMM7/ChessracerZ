1. user creates a IAM user
* which gives access to resouces like this

    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2',
         aws_access_key_id='AKIAUCXTXAAIXQCVARSC',
         aws_secret_access_key='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',
         region_name='eu-west-2')

save this credentials to the user or on the server

3. creates ec2 instance -> is where client will d

4. enable automatic deployment

*authentication flow:
1. firebase google authentication token to identify user's id on the backend
2. if user has set up a server with deployments, bring all info to the frontend


*things that need to be stored in the user database:
-aws_access_key_id
-aws_secret_access_key
-region_name
-user name

*making users is done with a different set of
-aws_access_key_id
-aws_secret_access_key
-everything else is done by a user's own unique
set of aws_access_key_id andaws_secret_access_key
